# Benchmark.py Analysis Documentation

## Overview

The `benchmark.py` file implements a comprehensive protein subfamily classification system using deep learning. It processes protein domain data to predict protein subfamilies using a neural network classifier with detailed evaluation and reporting capabilities.

## Data Input and Structure

### Input Data Source
- **File**: `data_old.csv` from the `data_source` directory
- **Expected Columns**:
  - `Domains`: String representation of lists containing domain information
  - `Seperator`: String representation of lists containing separator region information
  - `Subfamily`: Target classification labels
  - `Protein length`: Length of the protein sequence
  - `Protein`: Protein identifier

### Data Format Details
- **Domains**: Each domain contains `[accession, start_pos, end_pos, score]`
  - Accession format: `CDD:XXXXX` where XXXXX is numeric
  - Positions are absolute coordinates in the protein
  - Scores represent domain confidence/quality
- **Separators**: Each separator contains `[type, start_pos, end_pos]`
  - Represents regions between domains
  - Positions are absolute coordinates

## Core Classes and Functions

### 1. ProteinDataset Class

**Purpose**: Custom PyTorch Dataset class that processes protein domain data into machine learning features.

**Key Features**:
- Converts string representations to actual lists using `ast.literal_eval()`
- Creates comprehensive feature vectors from domain and separator information
- Implements label encoding for subfamily classification
- Normalizes features for better model performance

**Feature Engineering Process**:

#### Domain Features
1. **Domain Presence Vector**: Binary vector indicating which domains are present
2. **Domain Position Features**: Normalized start/end positions (divided by protein length)
3. **Domain Scores**: Log-transformed domain confidence scores
4. **Domain Order Features**: Sequential order of domains in the protein
5. **Domain Count**: Normalized count of domains per protein

#### Separator Features
1. **Position Features**: Normalized start/end positions of separator regions
2. **Length Features**: Normalized length of separator regions
3. **Padding**: Fixed-size feature vector (max 20 separators × 3 features = 60)

#### Feature Normalization
- Z-score normalization: `(features - mean) / std`
- Handles zero standard deviation to avoid division errors
- Applied to entire feature matrix for consistent scaling

**Methods**:
- `__init__(df, max_domains=50)`: Initializes dataset with feature processing
- `__len__()`: Returns dataset size
- `__getitem__(idx)`: Returns feature-label pairs for training

### 2. ImprovedProteinClassifier Class

**Purpose**: Deep neural network for protein subfamily classification.

**Architecture**:
- **Input Layer**: Variable size based on feature dimensions
- **Hidden Layers**: Configurable (default: [512, 256, 128])
- **Activation**: ReLU activation functions
- **Regularization**: 
  - Batch normalization after each hidden layer
  - Dropout (0.4) for preventing overfitting
- **Output Layer**: Linear layer with softmax for classification

**Key Features**:
- **Weight Initialization**: Kaiming normal initialization for ReLU networks
- **Batch Normalization**: Improves training stability and convergence
- **Dropout**: Reduces overfitting during training

**Methods**:
- `__init__(input_dim, num_classes, hidden_dims)`: Network architecture setup
- `_init_weights(module)`: Custom weight initialization
- `forward(x)`: Forward pass through the network

### 3. Data Splitting Strategy

**Function**: `custom_split_dataset(df)`

**Purpose**: Implements a sophisticated data splitting strategy that handles imbalanced subfamily sizes.

**Splitting Rules**:
1. **Single Member Subfamilies**: Protein appears in both training and test sets
   - Rationale: Ensures all subfamilies are represented in both sets
   - Prevents complete loss of rare subfamilies
2. **Two Member Subfamilies**: 1:1 split (one for training, one for testing)
   - Balanced representation while maintaining separation
3. **Multiple Member Subfamilies**: 80:20 train-test split
   - Standard machine learning practice for sufficient data

**Benefits**:
- Handles class imbalance effectively
- Ensures all subfamilies can be evaluated
- Maintains data integrity for rare classes

### 4. Evaluation and Analysis Functions

#### `analyze_misclassification_type(true_subfamily, pred_subfamily)`

**Purpose**: Categorizes prediction errors based on taxonomic hierarchy.

**Logic**:
- Extracts family information (first 3 parts of subfamily identifier)
- Classifies errors as:
  - `same_family`: Misclassification within the same protein family
  - `different_family`: Misclassification across different families

**Importance**: Helps understand if errors are minor (within family) or major (across families).

#### `evaluate_model_detailed(model, data_loader, dataset, device, original_df, train_indices)`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive model evaluation with detailed subfamily-level analysis.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- **Per-Subfamily Metrics**:
  - Training sample count
  - Test sample count
  - Accuracy percentage
  - Detailed misclassification analysis
- **Error Analysis**:
  - Same-family vs. different-family errors
  - Confidence scores for predictions
  - Individual protein misclassification details

**Output**:
- Detailed subfamily report dictionary
- Results DataFrame with all predictions and confidences

## Training Pipeline

### 1. Data Preparation
```python
# Load and process data
dataset = ProteinDataset(df)
train_indices, test_indices = custom_split_dataset(df)
train_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(dataset, train_indices)
val_dataset = torch.utils.data.Subset(dataset, test_indices)
```

### 2. Class Imbalance Handling
- **Weighted Loss Function**: Inverse frequency weighting for rare classes
- **Class Weights Calculation**: `weight = 1 / class_frequency`
- **Normalization**: Weights are normalized to sum to 1

### 3. Model Configuration
- **Optimizer**: AdamW with weight decay (0.01) for regularization
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler
- **Loss Function**: Weighted CrossEntropyLoss
- **Additional Regularization**: L2 regularization (λ=0.001)

### 4. Training Loop Features
- **Early Stopping**: Patience of 15 epochs based on validation accuracy
- **Model Checkpointing**: Saves best model based on validation performance
- **Gradient Clipping**: Max norm of 1.0 to prevent exploding gradients
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time loss and accuracy monitoring

### 5. Training Optimizations

2. **Single Subfamily Families (<100% Accuracy)**: Some errors
3. **Multiple Subfamily Families (100% Accuracy)**: Perfect discrimination
4. **Multiple Subfamily Families (<100% Accuracy)**: Some confusion
